# ROIcoin Release Notes for v1.2.0.0

Changes in 1.2.0.0

- issue #15 a new flag -autoban (default is off) was introduced to automaticaly ban peers for 24hrs if they returned "Connection Refused" or "Host unreachable". This will reduce the cpu load when handling peers.
- issue #16 a new flag -banobsoleteversion (default is off) was introduced to automaticaly ban peers for 24hrs who have obsolete old wallet version ( < v1.1.3 ).
- issue #19 the wallet rpcport was wrongly configured and conflicted with the p2p port, this explains a lot of slow syncing and low peer counts we have been experiencing. The rpcport is now set to 3376
- issue #22 the sending addressbook will now contain the send and receive addresses combined , this will facilitate sending matured coins or combining inputs to yourself.
- windows 64 cross-build instructions were added to the doc folder.

## Upgrading and downgrading
### How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions).
Backup your wallet.dat file ( which you should always do regardless of an upgrade event )
then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over ROIcoin-qt (on Linux).

# ROIcoin Release Notes for v1.1.3.0

## Optional BETA Release to help System Administrators

In my daily duty to manage the seed nodes and block explorer , I often encounter malicious peer nodes.
To help administrators out there I have added the following 3 new RPC calls, 
These RPC calls are available both via ROIcoin-cli and the GUI debug window.

* setban ip or ip/netmask add/remove  - manually add or remove a peer to ban list
* listbanned  -  list banned peers
* clearbanned -  clears all banned

Note: banlist is persisted in banlist.dat file, so the server will remember on restart.

Example:

```code
ROIcoin-cli setban 10.10.10.15 add
ROIcoin-cli listbanned
 [
   {
       “address” : “10.10.10.15/255.255.255.255",
       “banned_until” : 1514554316,
       “ban_created” : 1514467916,
       “ban_reason” : “manually added”
   }
 ]
 ROIcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep 10.10.10.15
  gone !!
```

Note: This can also be helpful in temporarily banning peers who are on the wrong chain.
Warning: this is a PRE-RELEASE, I am still endurance testing it, its in use on our seed nodes.

# ROIcoin Release Notes for v1.1.2.0

## Emergency Release
The previous critical bug fix in v1.1.1 created a consensus disagreement between 2 windows miners mining the same block, Miner1 was on v1.1.0 and Miner2 on v1.1.1, both had a different result when calculating fees. This caused a fork in our block chain at height 29732

To resolve this situation we are hard forking at block nr. 31000 to make sure all miners are on v1.1.2.

## Checking your blockchain
In addition to mandatory upgrade, you may need to reindex your blockchain to the same chain our 
exchanges and block explorer are using.

Go to Help->debug window-> console tab and type "getblockhash 29732"
if you see "0000006aef642158383b16bd16b67d762a41a63ae2cfbdc6479d65d229818175" then you
are on the correct chain, otherwise you need to:
 * delete your blockchain folders named "blocks" and "chainstate" usually stored in c:\users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\ROIcoin and on linux in $HOME/.ROIcoin folder.
 * download our bootstrap-27122017-chain-x175.zip file
 * unzip it 
 * run ROIcoin-qt.exe -loadblock=c:\FULL-PATH-TO\bootstrap.dat 

## How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions). 
Backup your wallet.dat file ( which you should always do regardless of an upgrade event ) then just copy over ROIcoin-qt.exe (win64) or ROIcoin-qt (linux).

# ROIcoin Release Notes for v1.1.1.0

This release contains one critical and some minor fixes.

- issue #6 A variable initialisation bug in the interest rate calculation caused 
           windows wallet to crash. (found by elbandi)

- issue #7 The windows miner stops after encountering a block validation error 
           due to "too high fee". (caused by issue 6)
           We added a retry mechansim around runtime errors, the timeout is 
           configurable via a new flag called "-minerblocktimeout" (default 30000 ms) 

Other minor fixes:
- max outbound connections was increased from 8 to 16
- roicoin.icns was fixed for the MAC OSX wallet
- build instructions are now provided for MAC OSX, CentOS7 and Fedora27

Both issues were only affecting windows users, but we still recommend all users to upgrade to v1.1.1

# ROIcoin Release Notes for v1.1.0.0

This release contains one critical and some minor fixes.

- The critical fix is for the term deposit interest rate algorithm bug that kept increasing on every block.
- The new wallet will make sure that if you have pre-fork locked term deposits, the maturation interest will remain unchanged.
- New term deposits created after the hardfork will obey the new term deposit rates:

| Time     | Start Coins | End Coins | Coin Gain | Interest |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| 1 week | 1000 | 1021 | 21 | 2,10% |
| 2 weeks | 1000 | 1043 | 43 | 4,30% |
| 1 month | 1000 | 1096 | 96 | 9,60% |
| 3 months | 1000 | 1331 | 331 | 33,10% |
| 6 months | 1000 | 1929 | 929 | 92,90% |
| 12 months | 1000 | 6933 | 5933 | 593,30% |

The PoS calculation has been adjusted to 15% APR 

**Note:** the old HOdl per block 30 day interest still applies on top of ROI PoS rate.

We also applied cosmetic branding changes to the Wallet splashscreen and background.

## Hardfork at block 25000
### Notice to miners:
* If you are solo-mining you must upgrade to v1.1.0.0 before reaching block 25000 , any blocks found with the old wallet after the fork will be on the wrong chain !.
* If you are pool-mining make sure to check with the pool owner that their wallet has upgraded to v1.1.0.0 before block 25000
* Exchange owners please upgrade to v1.1.0.0 as soon as possible.

### Downgrade warning

Because this release issues a hard-fork of the network, downgrading to prior versions
will not be possible once the network reaches a block height of 25000.
